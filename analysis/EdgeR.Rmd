#EdgeR-analysis
EdgeR-analysis of contrast TNvsC for days 10 and 17 respectively. The analysis is carried out on KO-terms, which is a functional annotation based on the [KEGG-system.](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)

After thinking about the question to answer, and to reduce the complexity of having several contrasts due to more than one day. I suggest to focus on day 17, mainly due to the large differences in maintenance respiration, which is the adaptations we are looking for in the comparison.
```{r rm_plot, message=F, warning=FALSE, fig.cap = "Maintenance respiration values for C and TN treatments on day 10 and 17."}
rm_values %>%
  filter(day %in% c("12","19")) %>%
  filter(treatment %in% c("C","TN")) %>%
  group_by(day, treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_rm = mean(Rm_Rsb), stdev = sd(Rm_Rsb)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = day, y = mean_rm, colour = treatment, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_rm - stdev, ymax = mean_rm + stdev)) +
  ggtitle("Maintenane respiration C and TN treatments")
```

## Proceeding with day 17 comparison of gene exression

### Plot of differenially expressed genes
The KO-gene list annotations created by uploading a list of KO-terms to the [KEGG-website](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html).
```{r fig.height=10, fig.cap="Differentially exressed KO-terms, logFC denote logfoldchange for respective gene, colour represents significane and size represents abundance."}
edgeR_list %>%
  filter(day == "17") %>%
  filter(type %in% c("Up","Down")) %>%
  left_join(down17 %>% bind_rows(up17), by = "KEGG_ko") %>%
  mutate(gene = forcats::as_factor(gene) %>% fct_reorder(logFC, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = logFC, y = gene)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = logCPM, colour = fdr)) +
 # geom_segment(aes(x = -9, xend =logFC, y=gene, yend = gene)) +
  scale_colour_viridis(discrete = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Differentially expressed KO-terms")
```

### Upregulation in TN-treatment
To further investigate gene functions, KO-terms and gene functions of differential genes were collated into tables. The bulletpoint list is a selection of enes of interest, for the full range of genes search the tables.
* PstS is part of the high-affinity phosphate uptake system. 
* PhoAB are alkaline phosphatases. 
* PhnCEM - part of the pho regulon involved in organic P-uptake.
* Ena is an enamidase acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds.
* ctrA - [cell cycle](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0CAW8/entry) regulation.
* impF- type VI secretion protein
```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
kable(up17) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
    add_header_above(c("Table 3.Upregulated KO's in day 17" = 3), font_size = 18) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")
```
### Upregulation in C-treatment
* amt - ammonium transporter
* narHY,nxrB - nitrate reductase/ nitrite oxidoreductase
* narJW - nitrate reductase molybdenum cofactor assembly chaperone NarJ/NarW
* narGZ,nxrA -	nitrate reductase / nitrite oxidoreductase, alpha subunit [EC:1.7.5.1 1.7.99.-]
* nirK -	nitrite reductase (NO-forming) [EC:1.7.2.1]
* pmoA-amoA - methane/ammonia monooxygenase, moste likely an ammonia moonoxygenase.
* pmoB-amoB - methane/ammonia monooxygenase, moste likely an ammonia moonoxygenase.

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}

  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")
```

### Genes overlapping the target genes
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, res}
down_over <- nrow(target_genes %>%
  semi_join(down17 %>% separate_rows(gene, sep = ","), by = "gene")) 

up_over <- nrow(target_genes %>%
  semi_join(up17%>% separate_rows(gene, sep = ","), by = "gene"))

```
Within the differentially upregulated genes, `r down_over` were found within the target genes, and `r up_over` were found in the downregulated genes.
