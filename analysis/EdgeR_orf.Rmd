# EdgeR-analysis 
EdgeR-analysis of contrast TNvsC for day 17. The analysis is carried out on orf-level, allowing for identification of taxa specific responses. As compared to KO which look at the total regulation of a function irrespective of smaller taxa variations.

Out of a total of `r length(edgeR_orfs$orf)` orfs, `r length(edgeR_orfs %>% filter(type == "Up") %>% pull(orf))` are upregulated in the TN-treatment. While `r length(edgeR_orfs %>% filter(type == "Down") %>% pull(orf))` are upregulated in the C treatment.

# Summarising the taxonomy of the orfs

```{r}
#Investigating if orfs are in the list of target genes.
target_genes_present <- edgeR_orfs %>% #83604 rows 
  inner_join(eggnogs %>% distinct(orf, Preferred_name), by = "orf") %>% #Loosing unannotated orfs here #81 698 rows

list_overview <- target_genes_present %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  tally() %>%
  ungroup()
```
Among the orfs annotated in the target gene list,  `r list_overview %>% filter(type == "Up") %>% pull(n)` were upregulated,   `r list_overview %>% filter(type == "Down") %>% pull(n)` were downregulated and lastly `r list_overview %>% filter(type == "non-DE") %>% pull(n)` were not differentially expressed.

```{r}
kable(target_genes_present %>%
  filter(type == "Up") %>%
  select(-Category) %>%
    inner_join(taxonomy, by = "orf") %>%
    arrange(desc(logFC))
  ) %>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
    add_header_above(c("Upregulated  orfs in TN-treatment" = 22), font_size = 18) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```
These taxonomy of genes match the increase in taxonomy on the order level seen in the TN-treatment as opposed to the C-treatment (Burkholderiales and Flavobacteriales).

```{r}
kable(target_genes_present %>%
  filter(type == "Down") %>%
  select(-Category) %>%
    inner_join(taxonomy, by = "orf") %>%
    arrange(desc(logFC))
  ) %>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
    add_header_above(c("Upregulated  orfs in TN-treatment" = 22), font_size = 18) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```
Among the Down-regulated genes, oxidative stress and a type 1 restriction modification as well as an osmoregulatory gene (katG) were found to be downregulated in the TN-treatment, ATP-SYNTHASES from alpha-and gamma-proteobacteria were also found to be upregulated.

```{r}
#Looking at functions of the orfs and also doing this by taxonomy later
edgeR_orfs %>%
  inner_join(eggnogs %>% distinct(orf, Preferred_name), by = "orf")
