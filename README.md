# PROMAC_morphology

This project aims to connect gene expression of an aquatic microbial community with morphological differences seen through scanning electron microscopy in a mesocosm experiment. Two treatments appeared to have significant morphological differences, C and TN. Differences observed were:   
Blebbing of outer membrane, and release of membrane like vesicles are two characters which were significantly higher in TN treatment as compared to C, while the presence of pili all over surface were significantly higher in C in contrast to TN treatment.   
Connections between cells in combination with blebbing of outer membrane(Con + Blb) was the only combination which were significantly higher in TN in contrast to control.
